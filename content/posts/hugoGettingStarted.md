My aim was to play with Virtual Private Server (VPS) and get my own domain. This has begun when I have visited a friend of mine, who has build and maintain his on website using VPS server from [Forpsi.com](www.forpsi.com). Then the website itself is created using framework for building website called [HUGO](https://gohugo.io). So I took a note and in a couple of days I have spent an evening for domain creation and VPS creation on Forpsi.

### VPS settings
In order to set up the VPS properly I have recalled the old access to online tutorial ["Administrace VPS server≈Ø	- Online kurz"](https://www.itnetwork.cz/site/vps).

The course help me to install and configure:
- PHP
- MySQL
- Apache

After installing all this I had to connect the Apache server to the newly created domain.

### HUGO framework

I have started and followed the official website [Hugo getting started website](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). After that I was able to have a simple example website up to running and visible in my browser after typing a simple command `hugo server`. 


I wanted to customize my website, so I had a look on different themes available at [Hugo theme archive](https://themes.gohugo.io). I was looking for kind of personal website, which is representative but simple. Furthermore, I picked "[Hugo Initio](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-initio/)". Here you can find a [life demo](https://miguelsimoni.github.io/hugo-initio-site/) of Hugo Initio, from which I took inspiration.
